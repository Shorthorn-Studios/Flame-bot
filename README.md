# Flame Discord Bot
Flame Discord Bot is a Discord Bot with a general purpose. This bot was designed by musicmaestro360 and Edgewurth (Shorthorn-Studios). This bot uses [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) as it's API.

The bot needs a configuration file to be placed in the root directory where bot is installed.

This should be called Config.py. A sample file is available as Config.distpy - rename this file and edit to suit.
